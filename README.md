# 3D Gaussian Splat Viewer for Looking Glass

* Based off examples from https://github.com/mkkellogg/GaussianSplats3D
* And: https://github.com/looking-glass/looking-glass-webxr

I've committed the local builds temporarily because it relies on newer versions
of those libraries that have yet to be published on npm.
